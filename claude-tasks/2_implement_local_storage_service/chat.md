# Local Storage Service Implementation Chat

This conversation covers the implementation of the LocalStorageService with saveState and getState methods.

## Summary

Successfully implemented the LocalStorageService with the following features:

1. **saveState method**: Serializes and stores the full State object to localStorage using key 'palabs-app-state'
   - Returns true on success, false on failure
   - Overwrites existing state if present

2. **getState method**: Retrieves and deserializes the State from localStorage
   - Returns deserialized State object on success
   - Returns null if no state exists or deserialization fails
   - Clears localStorage if deserialization fails

3. **Comprehensive testing**: Added unit tests covering all scenarios:
   - Successful save and retrieval
   - Overwriting existing state
   - Handling localStorage errors
   - Handling missing state
   - Handling invalid JSON

4. **Documentation**: Added JSDoc comments to the service class and both methods

## Technical Notes

- JSON serialization doesn't preserve `undefined` values, so `typedIndex: undefined` properties in Letter objects are removed during serialization
- Tests account for this behavior using `jasmine.objectContaining()` for flexible matching
- Achieved 100% code coverage
- All lint checks pass

feat: implement local storage service with state persistence

Added saveState and getState methods to LocalStorageService:
- saveState serializes and stores the full State object to localStorage
- getState retrieves and deserializes the State from localStorage
- Returns null and clears storage if deserialization fails
- Includes comprehensive unit tests with 100% code coverage
```

The implementation is complete and pushed to the remote repository.
