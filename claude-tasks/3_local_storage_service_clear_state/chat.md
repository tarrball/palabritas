# LocalStorageService clearState Implementation

## Task Summary
Implemented the `clearState` function for the LocalStorageService to clear application state from local storage.

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made

1. **Added `clearState` method to LocalStorageService** (`src/app/3. services/local-storage.service.ts`)
   - Added a new public method that removes the state from localStorage using the existing storage key
   - Added JSDoc comment as required

2. **Added comprehensive tests** (`src/app/3. services/local-storage.service.spec.ts`)
   - Test case 1: Clears state when state exists in localStorage
     - Uses `saveState` to save mock state
     - Uses `getState` to verify state exists before clearing
     - Calls `clearState` to clear the state
     - Uses `getState` to verify state is cleared
   - Test case 2: Clears state when no state exists  
     - Uses `getState` to verify no state exists initially
     - Calls `clearState` to clear (no-op scenario)
     - Uses `getState` to verify state remains null

### Code Added

#### LocalStorageService (`local-storage.service.ts`)
```typescript
/**
 * Clears the application state from local storage
 */
clearState(): void {
  localStorage.removeItem(this.storageKey);
}
```

#### Tests (`local-storage.service.spec.ts`)
```typescript
describe('clearState', () => {
  it('should clear state from localStorage when state exists', () => {
    service.saveState(mockState);
    const stateBeforeClear = service.getState();
    expect(stateBeforeClear).toBeTruthy();

    service.clearState();

    const stateAfterClear = service.getState();
    expect(stateAfterClear).toBeNull();
    expect(localStorage.getItem(storageKey)).toBeNull();
  });

  it('should clear state from localStorage when no state exists', () => {
    const stateBeforeClear = service.getState();
    expect(stateBeforeClear).toBeNull();

    service.clearState();

    const stateAfterClear = service.getState();
    expect(stateAfterClear).toBeNull();
    expect(localStorage.getItem(storageKey)).toBeNull();
  });
});
```
