# Chat: Create LocalStorageService

## Human
Follow the instructions in /claude-tasks/1_make_local_storage_service/prompt.md

## Assistant
I'll read the instructions and create a localStorage service for the game.

First, I read the prompt.md file which contained strict implementation guidelines and the specific task:
- Create a LocalStorageService skeleton class
- Create a spec file with a test that checks if the service can be created

I created a todo list to track the task:
1. Examine existing services to understand the pattern
2. Create LocalStorageService skeleton
3. Create LocalStorageService spec file with basic test

### Step 1: Examined existing services
I looked at the existing `GameService` in `/src/app/3. services/` to understand the pattern used in this codebase.

### Step 2: Created LocalStorageService
Created `/src/app/3. services/local-storage.service.ts`:
```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class LocalStorageService {}
```

### Step 3: Created spec file
Created `/src/app/3. services/local-storage.service.spec.ts`:
```typescript
import { TestBed } from '@angular/core/testing';

import { LocalStorageService } from './local-storage.service';

describe('LocalStorageService', () => {
  let service: LocalStorageService;

  beforeEach(() => {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({});
    service = TestBed.inject(LocalStorageService);
  });

  it('should be created', () => {
    expect(service).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

### Verification
Ran the test to verify it works:
```bash
npm test -- --include='**/local-storage.service.spec.ts'
```

The test passed successfully with 100% code coverage.

## Human
Export this conversation into claude-tasks/1_make_local_storage_service as chat.md, commit that, and push.

## Assistant
I'll export this conversation, commit it, and push to the repository.
