## Repository README

# Palabritas

[Palabritas](https://palabs.app/) is a little word game I'm building. You are provided with a scrambled word and must find the unscrambled word and any word contained in that word.

For example, if your word unscrambles to be "SECURE", this word also contains "CURE", "SURE", "RESCUE", and so on.

Words are pulled from Webster's Unabridged Dictionary (August 22, 2009) provided by [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29765). It's not the best word list, but it'll do for now.

The game is still rough around the edges.

# Issue #45: [Auto]: Migrate to Angular 19

**Created by:** tarrball
**Created at:** 2025-08-22T21:59:00Z
**Labels:** claude-help-wanted, auto

## Description

## Summary

Migrate the Palabritas application from Angular 18.2.2 to Angular 19 to stay current with the latest Angular version and benefit from performance improvements, new features, and security
updates.

## Current Behavior

The application is currently running on Angular 18.2.2 with associated packages:

- Angular CLI ~18.2.2
- Angular DevKit Build Angular ^18.2.2
- NgRx 18.0.2
- Angular ESLint 18.3.0

## Expected Behavior

After migration, the application should:

- Run on Angular 19.x with all core Angular packages updated
- Maintain all existing functionality including the word game mechanics
- Pass all 31 existing tests with 100% coverage
- Build and serve successfully with no breaking changes
- Maintain compatibility with NgRx, Angular Material, and other dependencies

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All Angular core packages updated to version 19.x
- [ ] Angular CLI updated to version 19.x
- [ ] Angular DevKit Build Angular updated to version 19.x
- [ ] NgRx packages updated to compatible versions for Angular 19
- [ ] Angular ESLint updated to compatible version
- [ ] All existing tests pass (`npm test`)
- [ ] Application builds successfully (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Application serves and runs correctly (`npm start`)
- [ ] Linting passes with no errors (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] No deprecated API usage warnings in console

## Implementation Notes

- Use Angular CLI migration schematics: `ng update @angular/core@19 @angular/cli@19`
- Update NgRx packages to versions compatible with Angular 19 (likely 19.x)
- Update Angular ESLint to compatible version for Angular 19
- Check for any breaking changes in:
  - `src/app/app.module.ts` (NgRx StoreModule configuration)
  - `eslint.config.js` (ESLint configuration changes)
  - `angular.json` (build configuration changes)
  - Any deprecated Angular APIs used in components/services
- Verify Angular Material compatibility with Angular 19

## Related Context

- [Angular 19 Release Notes](https://github.com/angular/angular/releases)
- [Angular Update Guide](https://update.angular.io/)
- Current test suite has 100% coverage that should be maintained
- Application uses NgRx for state management which may need version alignment

## Testing Notes

- Run full test suite after migration to ensure no regressions
- Verify all 31 tests continue to pass
- Test application functionality manually:
  - Game loads and displays scrambled letters
  - Letter clicking and word submission works
  - New game generation functions correctly
  - Header component renders properly
- Check browser console for any deprecation warnings or errors
- Verify coverage report still generates correctly


## Acceptance Criteria

Please implement the feature/fix described above. Follow the existing code patterns and conventions in the repository. Write clear, atomic commits with conventional commit messages. Ensure tests pass if a test command is configured.
