# Palabritas

[Palabritas](https://palabs.app/) is a little word game I'm building. You are provided with a scrambled word and must find the unscrambled word and any word contained in that word.

For example, if your word unscrambles to be "SECURE", this word also contains "CURE", "SURE", "RESCUE", and so on.

Words are pulled from Webster's Unabridged Dictionary (August 22, 2009) provided by [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29765).

The game is still rough around the edges, but I'm working on it.
